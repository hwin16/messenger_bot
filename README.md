# FACEBOOK MESSENGER BOT USING DJANGO
This is the working copy of facebook messenger bot using Django. It is the carbon-copy of Node.js version supplied by facebook. The application is quite straightforward. 

## Prerequisites
* python3.6
* ngrok

## Run 
The way I tested the application is using [Test Drive](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/test-drive?testdrive_messengerbot=true) on facebook developer platform. You can use `ngrok http 8000` to bind django development server port to create virtual online url. Then, paste the `https` url generated by `ngrok` inside test drive. Then, you are good to go.
